Technical Breakdown (Core Techies): * For stacktraces: Detail the exception type, pinpoint the method and line number where the error originated, and trace its propagation. * For application logs or request/response logs: Identify key components (such as the service name, endpoint, error code, or HTTP status) and explain the underlying mechanism. * For logs from external services (e.g., Nginx or HTTPS): Clearly identify the log source and any correlation with internal services. * Note: For issues related to LMS or Encore, only identify the problem without suggesting any fixes or configuration changes. 3. Technical Breakdown (Rookies): * Provide a simplified explanation in everyday language. * For stacktraces: Describe what the error means and indicate where to look in the code. * For application or external logs: Explain the observed event (such as a failed request or server error) in simple terms without proposing specific fixes. 4.
